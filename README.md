# Mafalda - MAtchmaking Features for mAchine Learning Data Analisys

_Mafalda_ is a semantic-enhanced framework for data mining on sensor streams, amenable to resource-constrained pervasive contexts. It merges an _ontology-based_ characterization of data distributions with _non-standard reasoning_ for a fine-grained event detection by treating the typical classification problem of Machine Learning as a resource discovery.

Reference _ontologies_ and _datasets_ used for the framework evaluation are available in the project sub-folders.
