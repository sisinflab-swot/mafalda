# Reference ontologies

Two different modeling approaches were investigated to represent data ranges for the measured parameters within the knowledge base:

- mafalda-ap.owl: each data range associated to a concept was modeled by means of a pair of OWL _annotation properties_, named _maxValue_ and _minValue_, indicating the maximum and minimum value, respectively;
- mafalda-nr.owl: numerical data are mapped by means of _number restrictions_.
